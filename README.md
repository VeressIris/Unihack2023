An app created in 48 hours for Unihack2023 that aims to teach users new languages through their favorite songs.

Project name: Singuistics
Team name: BitBusters

The app we developed combines the joy of learning, the emotions conveyed through music, and the beauty of nature.

We envisioned an application that is user-friendly and interactive, serving as a valuable tool to learn a new language using favorite songs. The homepage features a search bar where users can input the song title and artist, a dropdown menu with a selection of languages, and a button to trigger translation into the selected language. Once the lyrics of the chosen song appear on the screen, users can tap on any unfamiliar word to view its English translation. Additionally, there is a button on the left side of the toolbar enabling users to navigate to another page ("Saved Words"), where they can find a list of words they choose to save. Moreover, both the background and the logo were digitally drawn adn designed to enhance the application's visual appeal.

The translation was achieved using **Google Cloud Translation API**, finding the link to the lyrics page was done using **GeniusLyris API**, finally, to get the lyrics themselves, we used a kind of **webscraping**.
